When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent value to the required cost.",
								"{@b Magic Items.} Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Several new magic items are described herein, but any existing magic item described in the Core Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM’s discretion, characters who can cast 5th level spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime.",
								"{@b Stable Delerium.} The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk {@condition contamination|DoDr} when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind.",
								"{@b Delerium Dust.} Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an antimagic field. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks for spell scrolls.",
								"{@b Improvised Weapons & Ammunition.} Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a sling or fashioned into a makeshift club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and non-contaminated creatures struck must succeed on a {@dc 10} Constitution saving throw or gain one level of {@condition contamination|DoDr}. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed."
